# Betting and Team stats for the 2022 NFl season **incomplete

Raw data acquired and derived from: 
272: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruendymendozachavez/nfl-2023-season-dataset
betting: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data?select=spreadspoke_scores.csv (spreadspoke_scores.csv)

note: the first dataset says '2023-season', but this is mislabaled, as these are the games/scores from the 2022 season, which ended in early 2023
